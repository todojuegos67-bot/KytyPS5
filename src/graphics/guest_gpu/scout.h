// The scout (KYTY_SCOUT): a thread that walks queue 0's graphics submissions as they are queued, ahead of
// the render thread, keeps the shader registers a table draw's evaluation reads (the stages' programs and user data)
// and evaluates the tables of each table draw whose pair it has a view of (the flat form TablePack made): the slots,
// the T#/S# words, the pixel stage's LOD statistics words and the V#s with their resolved entries' indices, as
// TableEvaluate's and TableGather's flat paths make them. The render thread takes that result as a ticket at TableDraw,
// checked against its own registers, the pair, the mapping epoch and the tables' pages (no read watchers), instead of
// evaluating. Not checked at use: the game's tables themselves, read by the scout before the render thread reaches the
// draw (a CPU write the GPU reads sits behind a wait the scout stops at; the verifier, 2, counts any difference).
// 0: off (no thread, nothing fed; the Steam Deck builds' default). 1 (the default): tickets used. 2: verifier: the
// render thread evaluates as without the scout and compares every ticket with its own result.
// The scout spins while it waits for the render thread only while the spin gate is open (spin-gate.h,
// KYTY_SPIN_GATE): while it is shut the scout stands down, leaving its submissions unwalked, and sleeps between feeds.
// A run on a page with read watchers is read from the backing instead of being refused, and its range goes into the
// ticket; at use the render thread proves each such range clean (TryReadGpuCleanBackingToHost, as its own read of the
// page would take it) and equal to the ticket's words.
// A ticket's slot words are in block order with the stages' segments (runs side by side in the block), one inline copy
// a segment (Ticket::segments; none: a stage without slots).
